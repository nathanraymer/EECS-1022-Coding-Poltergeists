| Project Title: Mini-Database (Definition)  |
|--------|

|Project Description: The application will consist of a database that returns a definition based on user input, much like a dictionary. Through user input, the user will have the ability to input a word they would like to search for, and the app will either display the definition of said word, or let the user know that the database does not contain the definition for that word. All words that can be found within the database will be listed vertically towards the side of the screen. If a word is not listed, the definition is not available within the application. Capitalization will be made to be insignificant and won’t affect the outcome of words inputted.|
|------|
| 1. User can select a word that’s within the list using a drop down menu  |
| 2. User can enter a word in the search box and complete a search by pressing the search button |
| 3. In the case the user inputs a word that is not in the database, the application will return “word not found” and will give the user the option to search again  |
| 4. Application will be made responsive and compatible with all android devices  |
| 5. Words will be listed vertically off to the side and in alphabetical order  |
| 6. Based off the user's search, other suggested words in the database will be given below that are similar to what has been searched |
| 7. Application will be scrollable so all words in the list can be found on the main screen  |
| 8. The user will be able to go back to the main screen after searching or choosing a word |
| 9. Drop down menu can be ordered to be made in ascending or descending order (a-z, z-a)  |
| 10. User can press a button that refreshes the screen and allows them to enter a new word  |
| 11. Synonyms and origins of a word in the database can be accessed when a word is entered or chosen, by pressing a “more” button  |
| 12. Application will be made clean, user friendly and very easy to navigate through  |
